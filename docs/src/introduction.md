FunctionFusion: Algorithm Composition Made Simple
Welcome to FunctionFusion, a Julia package designed to empower you to build, modify, and optimize algorithms with ease. FunctionFusion provides a flexible and intuitive framework for composing complex algorithms from smaller, reusable blocks. Whether you're prototyping a new idea, experimenting with different algorithmic approaches, or optimizing an existing workflow, FunctionFusion makes it easy to assemble, modify, and refine your algorithms.

Why FunctionFusion?
Algorithms are often built by combining smaller, well-defined components. However, managing these components and their interactions can become cumbersome, especially when you want to experiment with different configurations or replace parts of the algorithm. FunctionFusion simplifies this process by providing a unified interface for:

Composing algorithms from modular blocks.

Swapping components to explore different variations.

Maintaining clarity and structure in your algorithmic design.

With FunctionFusion, you can focus on the logic of your algorithm while the framework handles the composition and flexibility.

Key Features
Modular Design: Break down algorithms into small, reusable blocks.

Flexible Composition: Easily assemble blocks into larger algorithms.

Dynamic Replacement: Swap out components to experiment with different approaches.

Intuitive Interface: Designed for clarity and ease of use.

Extensible: Add your own blocks and customize the framework to suit your needs.

Example Use Cases
Machine Learning Pipelines: Compose preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.

Numerical Algorithms: Build solvers or optimizers from smaller mathematical operations.

Data Processing Workflows: Create reusable data transformation pipelines.

Algorithm Prototyping: Quickly test different variations of an algorithm.
