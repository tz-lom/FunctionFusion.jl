# Glue.jl

Algorithm composition framework which implements data driven algorithm construction.

Provides way to compose complex algorithms from simple computational blocks. 
The resulting algorithms can be easily modified by replacing blocks, and the performance of generated algorithm is same as you make it with regular julia code.

> Can visualize resulting algorithms with GraphViz.
