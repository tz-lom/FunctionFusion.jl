## Why FunctionFusion?

Algorithms are often built by combining smaller, well-defined components. However, managing these components and their interactions can become cumbersome, especially when you want to experiment with different configurations or replace parts of the algorithm. FunctionFusion simplifies this process by providing a unified interface for:

- **Composing algorithms** from modular blocks.
- **Swapping components** to explore different variations.
- **Maintaining clarity and structure** in your algorithmic design.

With FunctionFusion, you can focus on the logic of your algorithm while the framework handles the composition and flexibility.

## Key Features

- **Modular Design**: Break down algorithms into small, reusable blocks.
- **Flexible Composition**: Easily assemble blocks into larger algorithms.
- **Dynamic Replacement**: Swap out components to experiment with different approaches.
- **Intuitive Interface**: Designed for clarity and ease of use.
- **Visual**: Visualize your work to have a birds-eye view on your algorithms.
- **Performance**: No performance overhead.
- **Extensible**: Add your own blocks and customize the framework to suit your needs.
